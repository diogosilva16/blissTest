Recruitment exercise for Bliss Applications
## Project execution

in the terminal
#### `npm install`
#### `npm start`

## Technologies used

### `React 17.0.2`
Main packages used in react:

#### `npm i react-router-dom`
#### `npm i sass`
#### `npm i @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`

## Technology needs

### react-router-dom

##### - Main usage for route differentiation inside the app and component definition based on route url

### Sass + File Watcher

##### - Compile Sass into CSS in real time

### Material UI Icons

##### - Usage of some material UI icons

## Improvements 

##### ps: Analysis on what could be done in the app

### CSS

##### - Improvements on the overall app's responsiveness. I believe I covered this issue em every screen, but there's the chance that I might've missed something

### General

##### - Every functionality and it's possible outcomes have been tested. Taking in consideration that some endpoints were not working correctly, all requests and payloads were checked and they turned out to be ok. This made it hard to test inside the app (visually), since there was no feedback on what was happening sometimes (an example of this is, when choosing an answer - voting - I chose to update the value instead of following the information that I was seeing on the Response tab (Swift: 1 and the rest 0).)

## What did I take from this

#### - Overall, this allowed me to refresh my memory on React. It has been a while since I've coded something in JS, but I think the results are positive. There will always be room for improvement and I'm sure this project (and all I've (re)learned with it) is the starting point of something great.
